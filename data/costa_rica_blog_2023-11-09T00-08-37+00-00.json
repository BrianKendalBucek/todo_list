Since Grecia has become a haven for many retirees, I always make it a point to include a visit there during the Central Valley portion of my monthly relocation/retirement tours . Grecia is mainly a farming town, mostly coffee and sugarcane, but also some produce and citrus. It is also known as the cleanest town in Costa Rica, but not for long. Recent events have led me to change my opinion about this area. In the no- too-distant future the town’s quality of life is bound to go down hill rapidly due to the following factors:",
            "The main highway that leads to Grecia is littered with unsightly mom and pop used car lots on both sides of the road. There are between 50 and 60 of them according to my last count. I find them to be an eyesore when approaching the town.",
            "Additionally, there are several mammoth housing developments being built just off the road with the goal of turning once-tranquil Grecia into a bedroom community for San José. One of these gated-communities is projected to become a small city with over a 1000 homes. Due to fact that there is only one two-lane highway that leads to and from the Grecia, once these projects are completed, traffic will be horrendous and affect the quality of life.",

Lately, the nearby Poás Volcano has been closed to visitors due to the danger it poses. I am not a vulcanologist and cannot predict what will happen in the future. What I do know is that I do not relish the idea of living on the slope of any volcano. Just look at what’s happening in Hawaii as I write this article. Living close to any volcano can be a disaster waiting to happen with home owners dreams can go up in smoke.",
            "If expats are interested in properties with a view, then they have to travel 15 or twenty minutes uphill from the center of town. I find it ludicrous that some of the realtors say that properties with a view are only ten minutes away. I have personally timed the trip from central Grecia to see properties at higher elevation and find it takes a lot longer than advertised. Potential residents should be aware that during the rainy season driving in Costa Rica’s hills or mountains is not for the faint of heart. I have actually been caught in a flash flood and a “white out” with “zero” visibility while driving through the country’s mountainous terrain.",
            "Another issue is that many of the properties with are overpriced. Atenas, has expensive properties with panoramic views, but they are much more accesible than those in Grecia. The former is also not as crowded and closer to good private medical care, shopping and the beaches of the Central Pacific.",
            "On my tours I have visited the homes of numerous expats living in Grecia who are trying to sell their homes. Most return to the States due to illness, lack of cultural adaptation, to be closer to their grandchildren or just plain boredom after the luster wears off.",
            "Grecia is also very boring for single expats as I have been told repeatedly.",

Those who suffer from allergies or reparatory problems may be adversely affected by these yearly “quemas,” as they are called here.",

It is incumbent upon this writer to provide objective information in order to help future expats make prudent decisions when doing their due diligence on relocating here.",
            "1. Now let’s look at the facts. International Living only holds its conference in Costa Rica once a year. Whereas the ARCR’s seminar takes place every month except for December when many of the local lecturers are outside the country due to the Christmas and New Years’ holidays. This makes their seminar easier to fit into one’s schedule.",
            "2. The ARCR is based in-county with around 30 years of experience helping expats with a variety of ancillary services: Obtaining residency and health care insurance, opening a bank account, getting a driver’s license, receiving mail from abroad, providing valuable contacts, offering a full-time presence to answer all of one’s questions and providing invaluable and impartial advice. On the other hand, IL has a very limited permanent presence as an organization in the country.",
            "3. The cost of the ARCR’s seminar for non-members is $70 and $50 for members (including lunch on both days and coffee breaks). International Living charges far more than for their conference; as a matter of fact over TEN times more. Just contact them and you will see the huge difference in price.",
            "4. Furthermore, only a couple of International Living’s guest speakers have lived in Costa Rica for any real length of time to be truly considered experts in the country. A couple of them are native Costa Ricans and are certainly qualified, but the majority have only lived here a few years or are just visiting as guest lecturers. Except for the Costa Ricans, none of IL’s people speak Spanish with enough fluency to comprehend the nuances of the country’s culture. Indeed they are true ‘foreigners” and always will be. On the other hand, there are two speakers at the ARCR’s seminar who were not born here but speak Spanish with native fluency and have lived here for 54 and 38 years respectively. Both of them are certainly more qualified to expound on the subject of living in Costa Rica than International Living’s mostly neophyte guest speakers.",
            "5. In Il’s magazine and online daily letters nothing negative is ever stated about Costa Rica. The “sugar coat” everything and paint the country as a fairy tale. Just read their material and you will be hard-pressed to find anything bad mentioned. Granted Costa Rica is one of the best places to live in the world but it is NOT a utopia or paradise. There are a few negatives here but when compared to most countries our problems are minuscule. At the ARCR’s seminar, you will hear the good, bad and ugly from both Costa Ricans and expat straight-shooters who have resided here for decades. Potential expats will find out what to really expect.",
            "6. I find it strange that it took International Living so many years to rate Costa Rica as the number one retirement destination. For years they placed areas like Boquete, and Panama on the top of their list. The latter cannot even come close to Costa Rica nor can the rest of Panama. Costa Rica has more places to reside and so much more to offer.",
            "7. Unfortunately, many expats base their decision on the cost of living and not the quality of life. In Spanish we say, “Lo que algo vale, algo cuesta’” which translates as “You get what you pay for.”",
            "8. International Living’s copywriters have even praised Nicaragua as a place to retire. See this link: https://internationalliving.com/countries/nicaragua/retire-in-nicaragua/ Again, you get what you pay for. Just take a look at recent events that have transpired in that country. Nicaragua has always had a tumultuous and unstable past with a documented history of confiscating foreigners’ properties. I rest my case.",
            "9. I noticed that IL also offers property tours before and after their conference. The ONLY show a few select properties and projects with which they are affiliated for obvious reasons. Although the ARCR does not offer property tours nor are they in the real estate business, upon request they can recommend brokers who have a much broader selection of properties from which to choose. They do not channel clients into selected projects. Check out their magazine or contact them directly to find a broker.",
            "10. Finally, IL’s Costa Rica conference does have some limited value for those gathering information, but it cannot “hold a candle “ to the ARCR’s two-day monthly seminar or its ongoing services."

The low crime rate means you can feel safe just about anywhere in the country, day or night. There is a focus on preserving the environment, with 25% of the country’s territory protected.

Since then, it’s had a stable government, a democracy with peaceful elections. The money that would go to the military is used to fund education for all (the literacy rate is 96%) and a solid national healthcare system, which is open to expat residents at a very low cost—averaging about $95 a month per couple.

Some have even found relief from chronic conditions.

I have also discussed the advantages of moving to Central America in over a hundred of articles on my blog.",

That comparison requires that I eliminate El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as possibilities because those Central American countries have never been considered retirement havens, due to the rampant crime, poverty, and gang violence. And, at the present time, relocation to Nicaragua is out of the question because of the serious political unrest there.

With the backing of the United States, Panama seceded from Colombia in 1903, allowing the construction of the Panama Canal. The canal was completed by the US Army Corps of Engineers between 1904 and 1914, and in 1977 the Torrijos-Carter Treaty led to the transfer of the control of the canal from the United States to Panama on December 31, 1999.",

Except for its mountainous areas as the northwest, Panama is mainly a flat, low-lying country with a hot, humid climate. It has a long rainy season (May to January) and short dry season the remaining months. The hot and humid climate can be very oppressive at times, and makes air-conditioning a necessity most of the year round. Owners of homes, condos, or apartments in Panama City can expect to spend at least a couple of hundred dollars on A/C monthly.",

As I just alluded to, Panama City, which is only 622 miles from the equator, is very hot. Coronado is expensive, Sante Fe is off the beaten path, and Boquete is isolated, since it is in the remote northwest corner of the country near the City of David and the border with Costa Rica. The rest of the country is fairly desolate and few retirees choose to live there.",

Attractive discounts are offered for elderly Panamanian citizens and foreign residents in a wide range of areas: Importing an automobile tax-free every two years, a one-time exoneration of up to $10,000 in household goods importation duties, plus reduced prices on transportation, restaurants, doctor’s visits, entertainment and more. These programs are very appealing to anyone who wants to save money, especially to those who receive small pensions and must be cost conscious.",

Good information is the key to making the right decision about where to live, so in this I’ll attempt to give you the basic facts about healthcare you’ll need to make the proper decision.",
            "I have lived in Costa Rica for nearly 40 years, so I can only write about my personal experiences with the healthcare options here. I have had two minor surgeries in that time; the first to repair a hernia, the second was arthroscopic surgery on both knees. My son had an appendectomy in 2001. All three operations were performed at the Clínica Bíblica in San José. Clinica Biblica, which was was founded in 1929, is the country’s oldest hospital. I have been using Clinica Biblica since the mid-1980s and am extremely happy with the quality of care that I and my family have received there over the years. Now days there are several other, world-class hospitals and clinics in the Central Valley which also provide first-class healthcare.",

            "The second is the private healthcare system. This system is comprised of several top quality hospitals and clinics. These centers are affordable, of the highest quality, and are readily available. There are four large, private hospitals that most expatriates use: CIMA hospital in Escazú, Clínica Bíblica in San José, and Hospital La Católica in San José-Guadalupe. Hospital Metropolitano is the country’s newest private medical provider and offers a novel, inexpensive discount program to reduce medical costs. Called MediSmart, many expats who have used the program swear by it.",

            " for more information. And, for those who want it, there are various private insurance plans available, with the National Insurance Company (INS) being the most popular.",
            "The quality of medical care in Costa Rica is recognized as being excellent. In 2018 International Living chose Costa Rica as the number one country for retirement and relocation. Part of the reason for selecting the country is its healthcare system. International Living said, “Costa Rica offers some of the best healthcare in Latin America.”",
            "Evidence of the quality is that Costa Rica has a longevity rate which is equal to many so-called first world countries. Statistics from the World Health Organization frequently place Costa Rica in the top rankings in the world for longevity.  According to official statistics, Costa Ricans who reach eighty-years old enjoy the longest longevity rate in the world. In fact, the country boasts a community centenarians who live on its Nicola Peninsula in an area called a “blue zone.” The availability of good medical care and other factors, such as lifestyle, play an important role in this impressive statistic.",
            "Of importance to those considering relocating to Costa Rica, is that medical costs are low, in comparison to those in the U.S. and even many European countries; typically about one-third to a one-fifth of what is charged in the U.S., depending on the treatment. But don’t just take my word for it, to see a comparison of medical costs here: http://ticotimes.net/costa-rica/medical-costs-vs-us",

If you know the drug you need, ask a pharmacist if you can get it without a prescription; it will save you the cost and time of a trip to a doctor. (Keep in mind that the drug you know probably has a different name in Spanish, but many druggists have cross reference guides.)",

Keep in mind that the further away you are from those two major cities, the more likely you won’t have immediate access to top quality health care, and major health issues can necessitate a long bus ride or an expensive ambulance trip. This is the case for both private and public services.",
            "In Panama not all doctors who work in the public system speak English, so you may need a translator to accompany you. Public care is more affordable than private, and waiting times can be very long, with some drugs being scarce.",
            "Like Costa Rica, many medications that require prescriptions back home are available over-the-counter. Ask a pharmacist if you can get them. But remember, the drug may be named something else in Spanish.  In Panama, if you have a Residency Visa, you can buy some medicines at a discount at a Public Social Security Hospital. The more expensive prescriptions, however, are often not available in the public system. And, be aware, some drugs can be more expensive in Panama than in the USA or other western countries.",
            "The private system is more expensive than the public, but it is much faster and you are more likely to find doctors who speaks English in that system. Although the private system is more expensive than the public, relative to health care in the US, it is still very affordable. The private system is what the majority of expats use, as well as many middle and upper class Panamanians.",
            "Since health care is inexpensive in both Costa Rica and Panama, some people simply forgo it altogether; they simply pay out of pocket and self-insure. This is a good option for those who are in “good health” and can afford to do so.  If you don’t want to take such a risk, you’ll need to obtain health insurance.",
            "International medical insurance can cover you in both countries, or any other country, but it is by far the most expensive option. It is, however, still reasonable in comparison with similar insurance in many other countries. Such private insurance for expats is available from companies like ",

            "What really sets the two county’s apart is that Costa Rica has an organization dedicated to the needs of expats; the Association of Rentistas and Costericanese Retirees – ARCR (formerly known as the Association of Residents of Costa Rica). This organization, which has been around over 30 years, has the sole purpose of assisting expats to relocate, live, and become permanent residents of Costa Rica. An additional benefit of membership in ARCR is that it offers its members some discounted insurance options for their healthcare needs, including group plans.  Something that Panama does not have.",

There are homicides but there aren’t the mass and indiscriminate shootings since the gun laws are much stricter. A person can only own three handguns legally and assault rifles are not permitted.

            "In the last two years about 25 Americans that I know have moved from Costa Rica to Medellín, Colombia. You are probably asking why?",
            "There are two main reasons for them relocating. First, the cost of living in Medellín seems to be about 30 percent less than Costa Rica. Most of those who moved there are living on pensions and wanted to get more “bang for their buck.” For detailed information about the cost of living in Medellín see: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Medellin",
            "Second, the majority of those who relocated are single men who spend a lot of time pursuing women. No need to elaborate on this subject. I think readers can see between the lines. ",
            "Medellín’s spring-like climate is definitely not the deciding factor since Costa Rica’s Central Valley has even better weather with not as much pollution from automobiles. Medellín is located in a deeper valley making it difficult for the smog to dissipate. The times I have visited, there appears to be an inversion layer making it seem extremely polluted. Briefly, inversion is defined as a layer of the atmosphere in which there is a temperature inversion, with the layer tending to prevent the air below it from rising, thus trapping any pollutants that are present.",
            "One thing is for sure, since 1948 Costa Rica has virtually been at peace whereas Colombia (Medellín included) has been engaged in one violent conflict after another. Let’s look at Costa Rica first, since it’s recent history is less complicated and convoluted than both Colombia’s past and present. In 1948 Costa Rica officially abolished its military. Since it achieved this historic feat, it seems to suit its people just fine. The country has been ranked first in Latin America and 12th in world in happiness, according to the 2017 World Happiness Index. The Happy Planet Index also ranked it No. 1 in the world. ",
            "Costa Rica leads the Latin American and Caribbean region in health and primary education, having the second lowest infant mortality rate after Chile and a 98 percent literacy rate, according to the 2016-17 Global Competitiveness Report. The country also provides universal health care to its citizens and permanent residents. The World Health Organization ranks Costa Rica as having the best health care system in Central America and 36th best in the world.",
            "On the other hand, Colombia’s last 70 years have been a totally different story. Besides having an enduring history of conflict between the country’s liberals and conservatives, the year 1948 seemed to be start of what seems to be a never ending spiral of endemic violence. In 1948 Liberal Party leader Eliécer Gaitán was shot to death. Gaitán represented hope and a new beginning for Colombia’s people. His death marked the beginning of years of violence. Liberals blamed the conservatives for the assassination, so liberals began to kill conservatives. This era is sadly referred to as ",
            "or “The Violence” in English. As a result during this twenty-year conflict between between 100,000 and 200,000 people died. Colombian history is full of feuds that last for generations. It seems that Colombians have never been able to heal their societal wounds. All of this mess was fueled by the inequity that still exists between the social classes. This is exemplified by Colombia’s even stratified social system that ranks neighborhoods according to wealth.",
            "Unfortunately, new forms of violence came about after",
            ". Because of the country’s gap between the haves and have nots continued to grow, in starting in the 1960s Intellectuals, angry campesinos (peasants), dissidents and students took up arms. Leftist guerrilla groups like the FARC, ELN and M-19 emerged because of the discontent. To further compound matters, right-wing paramilitary groups were born and the result was an undeclared civil war which is still going on today with ELN and FARC splinter groups still operating. At its peak the FARC alone had almost 20,000 fighters. They eventually made peace with the Colombian government but the accord is very controversial since many Colombians do not agree with it since it lets many former guerrilla leaders off the hook for the crimes they committed. ",
            "Along the way the illegal right-wing paramilitary groups committed terrible atrocities including wiping out of entire towns. Fortunately, most of these paramilitary groups were demobilized in the first decade of this century but the effects of the genocide these groups committed still linger. The Justice and Peace Law of 2005, which disbanded the paramilitary, has bees been criticized for being too lenient and giving outright amnesty to criminals who perpetrated horrendous crimes against humanity.",
            "The emergence of Medellín’s Pablo Escobar in the 1980s added to the country’s bloodbath. In 1989 Forbes magazine considered Escobar to be the seventh richest man on the planet. Escobar and others turned Colombia into the Cocaine capital of the world and Medellín became the world’s murder capital ( about 400 per 100,000) as a result. As Time magazine called it, “The most dangerous city in the whole world.” ",
            "Cable cars, metro system and other improvements have contributed to Medellín’s recent success. The city has experienced a renaissance and was voted “The Come Back City of the Year.” However, despite this turn around over the last two decades, social inequalities and other issues still plague the city. Drug trafficking still exists — last year was bumper crop in Colombia. The city has approximately 240 different gangs with an estimated 5,000 members. The number of homicides in Medellin have increased after hitting an all-time low in 2015. The current murder rate is around 25 per 100,000 inhabitants. Although Costa Rica’s homicide rate has increased in recent years, it hovers only around 12 per 100,000 inhabitants for the whole country. One thing rarely seen in Costa Rica are metal reinforced security doors. From what I understand most apartments and homes in Medellín have them. Hmmmmmmm",
            ": Currently Medellín is very popular with expats and offers a high quality lifestyle. I have been there many times and have enjoyed every visit. The restaurants, culture and entertainment are hard to beat. Most of the Americans and Canadians I have met there seem to be very happy. The city is definitely my second choice for living after Costa Rica.. However, there is not enough there to make me move from here where I have family, friends and a successful relocation/retirement business. interestingly, I am in the process of starting a similar type relocation business in Medellín to take advantage of the burgeoning interest.

            "Recent massive protests (September and October 2019) between disenchanted Ecuadorians and the government have left hundreds of protestors injured. More than half of Ecuador’s 15 million people still live in poverty. They majority of this group are the country’s indigenous people who have been second-class citizens and disenfranchised through the country’s history. ",
            "Ecuador is also crime-ridden due to its precarious economy and not surprisingly tainted by corruption (number 33 in the world) at all levels. A popular expat blogger who lives there recently wrote,” pIckpockets, muggings are on the rise because people are desperate. Violent crime is not as common as in the U.S. although petty crime is widespread as in many poor countries.” Although, a businessman who I knew from his days in Costa Rica, was brutally murdered after setting up a shop in Ecuador. ",
            "Cuenca is really popular among expats but is located at a high-attitude which can make it difficult for anyone with allergies or breathing problems.",
            "Political stability is the most important factor for anyone about thinking about investing money in property or a home. Unfortunately, if you have a small pension or income you may have no other choice but move to a country with a low cost of living. But as we say in Spanish, “",

            "Getting to Ecuador is another obstacle. No matter where you live in the US or Canada, it may take more than one day to travel to Ecuador, especially Cuenca. Many of my former clients explore several retirement options before making their ultimate choice. All of them have stated categorically that it isn’t easy to get to Ecuador and for that reason they would not relocate there. On the other, Costa Rica is accessible in less than a day from most parts of North America.",
            "In an effort to lure tourists and potential retirees Ecuador even adopted the motto “Life in a pure state” which is striking similar to Costa Rica’s famous “Pura Vida.”",
            "I am sure that many people have lived there retirement dream in Ecuador, but the above will attest to the fact that Ecuador is not the best place to live or retire in Latin America. Costa Rica is not as affordable Ecuador but for retirement/relocation, but is a far better choice. Its great lifestyle, political stability, No military, year-round spring-like weather, large expat community, good medical care, stellar international reputation, track record and so much more combine to put it at the top of the list of retirement havens.

            "I’ve lived in Costa Rica for over twenty-one years, practicing law for seventeen of those years. I practiced law in Victoria, B.C, for fourteen years prior to moving to Costa Rica in August 1998. I would say, with that background, that I have a better than average understanding of the “mechanics” of both business and social norms and practices in Costa Rica.",
            "Since 2013, I have written blogs for Q Costa Rica on various topics, but in particular, about what I saw to be a growing trend toward an economic recession, which if not acted upon with corrective measures being implemented, would consume the country with insurmountable debt and public security problems. Unfortunately, in the years 2013, through 2018, this looming catastrophe became the “elephant in the room”, that no Tico wanted to speak about.",
            "The blogs that I chose to write on this issue are all available in the “Blogs” tab archives on the Q Costa Rica site, under my name. The first was entitled, “",
            "”, published in Q on October 13, 2013. In that blog, I highlighted a report from the Comptroller General for Costa Rica, indicating the significant rise in Public Sector salaries that was unsustainable and made reference to the state of affairs which existed in Greece at that time, which had arisen under similar circumstances as were then occurring in Costa Rica.",
            "In my blog published in Q on October 20, 2014, entitled, “",
            "”, I indicated how the increased Public Debt, related predominantly to the exorbitant salaries, benefits, and pensions paid to Public Sector employees and related onerous taxation on the Private Sector, was negatively impacting the ability to do business in Costa Rica. The following is a direct quote from this blog, “The Private Sector must be the “engine” for the economy in any country, for the country’s economy to be healthy, not the Public Sector.”",
            "In my blog published in Q on August 13, 2015, I made the following recommendations as to how I saw the potential solving of the country’s pending economic demise:",
            "1. Public sector wages and benefits must be capped and in the case of benefits, such as pensions, rolled-back. Wages, likewise must be rolled-back in an incremental manner over a short time period. Will this create a hardship for those affected; of course it will. Could there be civil unrest generated by such a move, as has happened in Greece under similar circumstances; yes, possibly it could.",
            "Do you want to point fingers at who is responsible for this economic mess of Public Sector wage and benefit spending being out of control; Oscar and Rodrigo Arias are your men to point at, as was admitted by them in the recent meeting with President Guillermo Solis. The Arias’ stated that they had not properly considered the effect of raising a few hundred upper level professional Public Sector salaries during the 2008 economic down-turn (Oscar Arias was President), as to the effect on the Public Sector salaries and benefits paid to the Civil Service employees as a whole.",
            "2. The tax structure and the related structure for the cost of doing business in Costa Rica must be made competitive with other countries to attract foreign investment into Free Trade Zones, the tourism sector, and the like. This will have the effect of stemming the current growing unemployment problem in the Country, put more money in the hands of employed Costa Ricans, and generate more general tax revenue through payroll deductions for those so employed. There will also be a reduced cost to the Government for social and domestic problem solving associated with the rising unemployment circumstances.",
            "3. The effective exchange rate between the Colon and the U.S. Dollar must be made real, as opposed the current Central Bank manipulated exchange rate currently in effect. The true exchange rate is probably somewhere between 600 and 700 colones to the U.S. Dollar. This will certainly be a hardship for those Costa Ricans paying loans, or mortgages in dollars, with wages and salaries being received in colones. Obviously, monthly payments to service such debts would rise for those affected by such an exchange rate adjustment. However, the adjustment would certainly stimulate the Exportation Sector of the Economy and would further bolster foreign investment in the Country and tourism in general; again, producing more general tax revenue.",
            "In my opinion, this three-point plan of attacking and solving the current economic crisis in the country, is the only viable plan to follow, but it will require a President and a Government as a whole, to have “the right stuff” to implement it.”",
            "It is interesting to note, that the current administration of President Carlos Alvarado, is now adopting some of these proposed solutions to the economic crisis. Hopefully, it is not “too little and too late”.",
            "Similar themes were expressed in my blogs published in Q, entitled “",
            "”, dated September 8, 2015, and “The Current Economic Crisis In Costa Rica, How Did It Arise?”, dated September 13, 2015.",
            "On May 2, 2016, my blog entitled, “",
            "”, was published. The theme of this blog was the “stop-gap” measure promoted by the Government of the day, to allow for easy consumer bank financing for new car purchases.",
            "The Government import duty on new cars is approximately sixty percent of the purchase price, which the citizenry was all too willing to undertake paying, for the pleasure of driving a new financed vehicle.",
            "In return, the Government was rewarded with the required revenue stream to finance the Public Debt for another short period of time, forestalling the inevitable.",
            "Now, that very available consumer credit has been compounded by out-of-control credit card debt, reducing the effective purchasing power of consumers to less than fifty percent of their monthly salary, with the rest going to debt servicing.",
            "In closing, I am of the opinion, that with some proactive planning and action commenced some years ago, the current economic recession might have been avoided, along with a lot of economic hardship for all of the citizenry of Costa Rica. Unfortunately, proactive problem solving is a sorely lacking attribute of Costa Rican thinking.",
            "My hope is that there is still time to effect the necessary corrective measures to avoid the descent into chaos and violence that has affected other countries, such as Greece, which have encountered similar circumstances in the past."

        "paragraphs": [
            "In the United States and elsewhere, public health and medical care are largely separate enterprises. Costa Rica shows the benefits of integrating the two—it spends less than we do on health care and gets better results.",
            "The cemetery in Atenas, Costa Rica, a small town in the mountains that line the country’s lush Central Valley, contains hundreds of flat white crypt markers laid out in neat rows like mah-jongg tiles, extending in every direction. On a clear afternoon in April, Álvaro Salas Chaves, who was born in Atenas in 1950, guided me through the graves.",
            "“As a child, I witnessed every day two, three, four funerals for kids,” he said. “The cemetery was divided into two. One side for adults, and the other side for children, because the number of deaths was so high.”",
            "Salas grew up in a small, red-roofed farmhouse just down the road. “I was a peasant boy,” he said. He slept on a straw mattress, with a woodstove in the kitchen, and no plumbing. Still, his family was among the better-off in Atenas, then a community of nine thousand people. His parents had a patch of land where they grew coffee, plantains, mangoes, and oranges, and they had three milk cows. His father also had a store on the main road through town, where he sold various staples and local produce. Situated halfway between the capital, San José, and the Pacific port city of Puntarenas, Atenas was a stop for oxcarts travelling to the coast, and the store did good business.",
            "On the cemetery road, however, there was another kind of traffic. When someone died, a long procession of family members and neighbors trailed the coffin, passing in front of Salas’s home. The images of the mourners are still with him.",
            "“At that time, Costa Rica was the most sad country, because the infant-mortality rate was very high,” he said. In 1950, around ten per cent of children died before their first birthday, most often from diarrheal illnesses, respiratory infections, and birth complications. Many youths and young adults died as well. The country’s average life expectancy was fifty-five years, thirteen years shorter than that in the United States at the time.",
            "Life expectancy tends to track national income closely. Costa Rica has emerged as an exception. Searching a newer section of the cemetery that afternoon, I found only one grave for a child. Across all age cohorts, the country’s increase in health has far outpaced its increase in wealth. Although Costa Rica’s per-capita income is a sixth that of the United States—and its per-capita health-care costs are a fraction of ours—life expectancy there is approaching eighty-one years. In the United States, life expectancy peaked at just under seventy-nine years, in 2014, and has declined since.",
            "People who have studied Costa Rica, including colleagues of mine at the research and innovation center Ariadne Labs, have identified what seems to be a key factor in its success: the country has made public health—measures to improve the health of the population as a whole—central to the delivery of medical care. Even in countries with robust universal health care, public health is usually an add-on; the vast majority of spending goes to treat the ailments of individuals. In Costa Rica, though, public health has been a priority for decades.",
            "The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the impoverished state of public health even in affluent countries—and the cost of our neglect. Costa Rica shows what an alternative looks like. I travelled with Álvaro Salas to his home town because he had witnessed the results of his country’s expanding commitment to public health, and also because he had helped build the systems that delivered on that commitment. He understood what the country has achieved and how it was done.",
            "When Salas was growing up, Atenas was a village of farmers and laborers. Cars were rare, and so were telephones. A radio was a luxury. In the country at large, barely half the population had running water or proper sanitation facilities, which led to high rates of polio, parasites, and diarrheal illness. Many children did not have enough to eat, and, between malnutrition and recurrent illnesses, their growth was often stunted. Like other societies where many die young, people had big families—seven or eight children was the average. Many children left school early, and only a quarter of girls completed primary education. Salas said that most children in Atenas started elementary school, but each year more and more were pulled out to do farmwork.",
            "Important progress was achieved in the nineteen-fifties and sixties in Costa Rica, with the kind of basic public-health efforts made in many developing countries. Salas was in kindergarten, he thinks, when his family was able to pipe running water to their home from the nearby city center. A national latrine campaign provided people with outhouses made of cement. National power generation brought electrical wiring. “The most happy person was my mother!” he said.",
            "Vaccination campaigns against polio, diphtheria, and rubella reached Salas and his classmates when he was in elementary school, as did a child-nutrition program that the government rolled out across the country, with aid from the Kennedy Administration. “We had this lunch—hot food,” he recalled. “I still have the flavor in my mouth. It was very nice to have a plate of soup with rice.” His family, with its cows and its store, was never nutritionally deprived—Salas grew to six feet—but his friends were often hungry. And so school attendance jumped. “The mothers and the families saw that it was a good idea now to send the kids to school, because they were fed,” he said.",
            "Along the way, the Ministry of Health provided an official in every community with resources and staff devoted to preventing infectious-disease outbreaks, malnutrition, toxic hazards, sanitary problems, and the like. These local public-health units, geared toward community-wide concerns, worked in parallel with a health-care system built to address individual needs. Still, both remained rudimentary in Atenas. The nearest hospital was sixteen miles away, in the city of Alajuela, and understaffed. “At that time, it was far, because the road was impossible,” Salas said.",
            "So when did Costa Rica’s results diverge from others’? That started in the early nineteen-seventies: the country adopted a national health plan, which broadened the health-care coverage provided by its social-security system, and a rural health program, which brought the kind of medical services that the cities had to the rest of the country. Atenas finally got a primary-care clinic. “With two or three doctors,” Salas recalled. “With five nurses. With social workers. For everything.” In 1973, the social-security administration was charged with upgrading the hospital system, including in Alajuela and other rural regions. In this early period, the country spent more of its G.D.P. on the health of its people than did other countries of similar income levels—and, indeed, more than some richer ones. But what set Costa Rica apart wasn’t simply the amount it spent on health care. It was how the money was spent: targeting the most readily preventable kinds of death and disability.",
            "That may sound like common sense. But medical systems seldom focus on any overarching outcome for the communities they serve. We doctors are reactive. We wait to see who arrives at our office and try to help out with their “chief complaint.” We move on to the next person’s chief complaint: What seems to be the problem? We don’t ask what our town’s most important health needs are, let alone make a concerted effort to tackle them. If we were oriented toward public health, we would have been in touch with all our patients, if not everyone in the communities we serve, to schedule appointments for vaccination against the coronavirus, the No. 3 killer in the past year. We would have coördinated with public-health officials to prevent cardiovascular disease, the No. 1 killer, by jointly taking aim at high blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking, and dietary salt intake. We would have made a priority of preventing disease, rather than just treating it. But we haven’t.",
            "In the nineteen-seventies, Costa Rica identified maternal and child mortality as its biggest source of lost years of life. The public-health units directed pregnant women to prenatal care and delivery in hospitals, where officials made sure that personnel were prepared to prevent and manage the most frequent dangers, such as maternal hemorrhage, newborn respiratory failure, and sepsis. Nutrition programs helped reduce food shortages and underweight births; sanitation and vaccination campaigns reduced infectious diseases, from cholera to diphtheria; and a network of primary-care clinics delivered better treatment for children who did fall sick. Clinics also provided better access to contraception; by 1990, the average family size had dropped to just over three children.",
            "The strategy demonstrated rapid and dramatic results. In 1970, seven per cent of children died before their first birthday. By 1980, only two per cent did. In the course of the decade, maternal deaths fell by eighty per cent. The nation’s over-all life expectancy became the longest in Latin America, and kept growing. By 1985, Costa Rica’s life expectancy matched that of the United States. Demographers and economists took notice. The country was the best performer among a handful of countries that seemed to defy the rule that health requires wealth.",
            "Some people were skeptical. Costa Rica had endured numerous economic crises before 1970; perhaps the subsequent decade of economic stability had made the difference. Or maybe it was the country’s large investment in education, which had lifted the proportion of girls who completed primary education from a quarter in 1960 to two-thirds in 1980. A careful statistical analysis indicated that such factors did contribute to child survival—but that eighty per cent of the gains were tied to improvements in health services. The municipalities with the best public-health coverage had the largest declines in infant mortality.",
            "A big question remained, though: Could Costa Rica sustain its progress? Public-health strategies might be able to address mortality in childhood and young adulthood, but many people believe that adding years from middle age onward is a wholly different endeavor. Countries at this stage tend to switch approaches, deëmphasizing public health and primary care and giving priority to hospitals and advanced specialties.",
            "Costa Rica did not change course, however. It kept going even farther down the one it was on. And that’s where Álvaro Salas comes in.",
            "Salas was an exuberant and ambitious child, and in high school he decided to become a doctor, inspired by two physician friends of his father’s who told stories about treating the wounded during the Second World War. He was one of only a few from his high-school class to go to college, and one of the first in his family to do so. When he enrolled at the University of Costa Rica, then the country’s sole public university, he imagined he’d return to Atenas to practice one day. As an undergraduate, though, he met people from across the country and came to understand that the gaps he’d experienced were present everywhere.",
            "“I became very active in politics,” he recalled. “But I hated the people who speak and speak and do nothing. So I decided to organize groups of premedical students to visit poor communities in the country and to bring students from the third year or fourth year in the school of medicine to treat them.” Salas turned out to have a Pied Piper charm and a talent for getting things done, even as a freshman. The medical school’s dean, he learned, had close connections at the Ministry of Health. He met with the dean, and came away with both medical-faculty support and ministry supplies for his venture.",
            "In his travels, Salas discovered that many of Costa Rica’s villages were even poorer than Atenas. “They had tuberculosis, they had leprosy, they had everything,” he said. He continued his volunteer work through college and medical school. And, as the country adopted its national health plan and spent more on public health, he could see not only what a difference such actions made but how much remained to be done. “My goals got bigger,” he said.",
            "In 1977, after his medical internship, he went to work in the Nicoya Peninsula, on a government-funded year of social service. Now a tourist destination, known for its beaches and for having one of the largest populations of centenarians in the world, the peninsula was then a remote and impoverished region, where medical care was sparse and lives were precarious.",
            "Salas was put in charge of setting up a new mobile public-health unit, one of many deployed in the government’s rural health program. When you work at a hospital, patients come to you. In a public-health unit, you have to go to them. Salas and his team made visits to villages along the sea. In addition to treating patients, they conducted household surveys, and pieced together diagnoses of whole communities. He found high rates of severe anemia among women, water contaminated with parasites, and outbreaks of respiratory infections. Owing to the new reforms, Salas could now do something about what he observed. Members of his team distributed iron tablets and vitamins and basic medicines such as antiparasitics and antibiotics. They helped organize sites for clean drinking water. They fought malaria and outbreaks of other infectious diseases. And, in the data they collected and the people they encountered, Salas could see the benefits.",
            "At year’s end, he was hired at a hospital in Puntarenas. But, after his experience in Nicoya, he did not think the way most clinicians do. “At that time in Costa Rica, it was very common to see people with blankets outside the hospital, pillows, waiting for a bed,” he told me. Elsewhere, people were living in squatter settlements and slums without roads, electricity, or sanitation. “For me, it was very clear that hospitals have a role, but we have to work at the community level first.” The government was building a housing development for around a thousand residents in a barrio called El Roble. Salas proposed to the hospital director that one of the new houses be turned into a neighborhood clinic—to save people from having to go to the hospital.",
            "Salas’s voluble exuberance was again persuasive. The director gave him a staff of two, and the housing authority gave him a house. The clinic was small, with a waiting room in front and an examining room in back. Just as in Nicoya, he and his team went door to door, creating a record for every family.",
            "“Didn’t people find that strange?” I asked.",
            "“I had a very nice uniform,” Salas said, laughing. “Green surgery scrubs.”",
            "He was a bear of a man, with a walrus mustache, a desk-drawer chin, and a head of dark, wavy hair; his ebullience was tempered with an air of kindness. No one in El Roble turned him away. “We knew everything,” he said. “Who is pregnant, who has a child, who has a malnutrition problem.”",
            "Salas became a neighborhood doctor and a public-health officer rolled into one. In addition to drawing blood for basic lab tests, he and his team collected stool samples to look for parasites. Because they also tested for blood in the stool, Salas detected one patient’s colon cancer early enough that it could be treated before it spread.",
            "A few months after opening the clinic, Salas asked the hospital to let him open another. The director again said yes. “Because the results were very good,” Salas said. “They had less people coming to the hospital—less lines, less waiting lists.” He set up a physician and more nurses in another Puntarenas barrio, a poorer one. “Again, the results were very good.”",
            "Then, one day, he got a call from a regional director of the country’s health-care agency, the C.C.S.S., known simply as “the Caja” (“the Fund”).",
            "“He was so angry, so angry,” Salas said. Salas had been commandeering C.C.S.S. doctors, nurses, and funds without going through proper channels. His engine of charm hit a barrier. “Who approved this project?” he recalls the director demanding.",
            "“I am responsible,” Salas replied.",
            "“No, you are not responsible,” the director told him. “You are irresponsible. Irresponsible in the worst sense possible, because you are making crazy things without any kind of studies.”",
            "The director delivered Salas’s punishment. Salas, at the age of twenty-eight, was to be the new head of the city’s central clinic. He was being kicked upstairs. “I had to move from El Roble to the center,” he said. He accepted it, but he didn’t give up: “I found that I had now my own resources, my own nurses, my own doctors. So I decided to continue with the project, but in silence.”",
            "The next election brought a change of government, and the new head of the C.C.S.S. was someone Salas knew from medical school. “So I went to San José saying, ‘Doctor, I have this project,’ ” he recalled. He brought pictures of the El Roble clinic, clicking through slides on a Kodak carrousel. The executive was impressed. “He said to me, ‘You have to show this to the President.’ ”",
            "They took the carrousel of slides to the President’s office that day. “The thing is that he used to live in Puntarenas,” Salas said. “So the President loved Puntarenas—loved.” He offered to provide whatever Salas needed. “I had a year in paradise with resources. That was amazing.”",
            "It was the late nineteen-seventies, however, and the oil crisis brought hyperinflation. Budgets were cut; jobs were lost. The El Roble clinic abruptly closed. Around the same time, across the northern border of Costa Rica, the Sandinistas had taken power in Nicaragua, in a bloody civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people were homeless. Many doctors had fled. Salas ventured north and found work in Nicaragua’s new government, helping to rebuild the health-care system along its impoverished Mosquito Coast, where no one else wanted to go.",
            "After three years, he returned to Costa Rica. Salas was now married to a young woman from Atenas and about to become a father. He took a job as a general practitioner in the city of San Carlos, and then found one in San Ramón, closer to his home town. There, a physician named Juan Guillermo Ortiz Guier had built a program called Hospital Without Walls, which had opened health posts not dissimilar to Salas’s El Roble clinic—but in dozens of neighborhoods. “That inspired me,” Salas said. He began talking to Ortiz and working with friends on a proposal to bring the essential concepts to Costa Rica’s entire health system.",
            "During the next eight years, Salas was promoted to run a major hospital in the capital and earned a master’s degree at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, but in 1990 he finally got the chance to put his ideas into action. He was appointed to lead policy development for the C.C.S.S., the Caja, working with a staff of fifty. Together, they delivered a plan for a universal system of care that would braid together public health and individual health.",
            "The plan had three principal elements. First, it would merge the public-health services of the Ministry of Health with the Caja’s system of hospitals and clinics—two functions that governments, including ours, typically keep separate—and so allow public-health officials to set objectives for the health-care system as a whole. Second, the Caja would integrate a slew of disparate records, combining data about household conditions and needs with the medical-record system, and would use the information to guide national priorities, set targets, and track progress. Third, every Costa Rican would be assigned to a local primary-health-care team, called an EBAIS (“eh-by-ees”), for Equipo Básico de Atención Integral en Salud, which would include a physician, a nurse, and a trained community-health worker known as an ATAP (Asistente Técnico en Atención Primaria). Each team would cover about four or five thousand people. The ATAPs would visit every household in their assigned population at least once a year, in order to assess health needs and to close the highest-priority gaps—the way Salas’s team in El Roble had done.",
            "The plan was at once breathtaking in scope and beautifully simple, and the President embraced it immediately. Funding it took longer. Although Costa Rica had a long track record of stability and economic growth, international financial institutions resisted Salas’s proposal. Providing real primary care, with a doctor on each team, would be too expensive, the World Bank said. “We could have a small package of basic services, no more than that,” Salas told me, recalling the negotiations. “But we already had that!” Hospitals were at capacity, and he insisted that the solution wasn’t just to build more of them.",
            "In 1994, the loans finally came through, and the plan was submitted to the legislative assembly, where it passed unanimously. A new government was elected, under the center-left President José María Figueres, but the plan had its full support. In fact, Figueres appointed Salas to be the head of the C.C.S.S.",
            "Getting the bill passed without opposition would seem no small feat: Salas had made his pitch to a center-right government, then retained the backing of a center-left one. But, if such unanimity is hard to imagine in the United States, President Figueres told me that it wasn’t surprising in Costa Rica. “This is something which, in our culture, is politically easy to sell,” he said. It would put a doctor, a nurse, and a community-health worker in every neighborhood. Who could object to that?",
            "Still, by the time Salas got the financing, there were just three years until the next election. So he rolled out the plan at breakneck speed. By 1998, when the government changed again and he left his post, the country had established enough EBAIS teams to reach about half the population, beginning with underserved rural areas. At that point, he wasn’t worried that the program would be dismantled. “It was in the news,” he said. “On the TV. We started in the north and then in the south. It became like a fashion to have an EBAIS. Everybody wanted one. The pressure to have an EBAIS became impossible to control.” By 2006, nearly the entire population had been enrolled with an EBAIS. Universal insurance coverage—to pay for hospitalizations and specialized care—would take longer. But universal primary care, delivered by more than a thousand local teams and with an emphasis on prevention and public health, was now a reality.",
            "Today, Álvaro Salas lives with his wife in San José and continues to advise the government, political figures, and, through media appearances, the public. He is seventy years old, with a fringe of short gray hair and a trim salt-and-pepper mustache. His attire leans toward track shoes with khakis and an Apple Watch. When I asked him to accompany me as I visited Atenas this spring, an outbreak of COVID-19 was rippling across the country. The pandemic had been under control for a year in Costa Rica, but more contagious variants had arrived and the I.C.U.s were full.",
            "On a sunlit, tropical morning, we made our way into town, past the palm-tree-filled park and the Spanish-style parish church, to the Atenas central clinic, a jumble of airy, low-slung, cream-colored buildings. Leonardo Herrera, an ATAP in the area, was preparing to head out for the morning’s home visits. In an open garage beside the clinic, several rows of elderly residents had just received COVID vaccines and were waiting in chairs for their observation period to end. For the now roughly thirty thousand people who live in Atenas and the surrounding area, there are seven fully staffed and equipped EBAIS teams.",
            "ATAPs, a category of clinician we don’t have, combine the skills of a medical worker and a public-health aide. They are professionally trained, salaried, and proud. Herrera, whose dark eyes showed a desire to get moving, wore a long-sleeved white shirt, blue pants, and black shoes, with credentials dangling from a lanyard around his neck. He carried with him a backpack of medical supplies, a tablet computer, and a cooler of COVID vaccines.",
            "Each ATAP is responsible for visiting all the people assigned to his or her team, which for Herrera represented about fourteen hundred households. The homes are grouped into three categories. Priority 1 homes have an elderly person living alone or an individual with a severe disability, an uncontrolled chronic disease, or a high-risk condition; they average three preventive visits a year. Priority 2 homes have occupants with more moderate risk and get two visits a year. The rest are Priority 3 homes and get one visit a year.",
            "That day, Herrera was bringing vaccines to Priority 1 patients who were unable to travel to the clinic. In Atenas, home visits are made on white Honda scooters or off-road motorcycles. In the most remote region, Salas told me, ATAPs must use boats or even horses to reach some families. We followed Herrera’s scooter in our car, along smoothly paved roads up and down green hills, to our first stop, a one-story stucco house with a fresh coat of yellow paint. Out front was a strange wrought-iron structure—an ornate crate on a chest-high post. Salas explained: you put your garbage bag in the holder on pickup day so street dogs don’t get at it. All the houses had one, each baroquely different from the next.",
            "A middle-aged man ushered us inside. A bookkeeper for local businesses, he lived with and cared for his mother, who had soft, probing eyes and advanced Alzheimer’s. The house had four rooms: two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom. In the front bedroom, the mother sat on the edge of a hospital bed that almost filled the space. Herrera checked her vital signs, including her temperature and her oxygen level, with a thermometer and a finger sensor from his backpack. He asked her and her son a few questions about how she’d been doing, including after her first vaccine dose, which he’d given her three weeks earlier.",
            "For each household, Herrera keeps an updated ficha familiar, a family file that provides the primary-care team with medical updates as well as detailed notes on living conditions.",
            "Behind the house, on a stone porch that opened onto a green postage-stamp lawn, Herrera pulled out a rectangle of brown butcher paper, flattened it on a table, and laid out all the vaccination materials. He went to the kitchen sink to wash his hands, using his own soap and paper towels.",
            "Herrera’s visit took about twenty minutes. As we headed down the road, I was struck not only by the efficiency of the visit but also by how ordinary it was: the man had been able to take it for granted that Herrera would visit on a certain day at a certain time to meet certain needs.",
            "I saw this reliability throughout our visits. Because everyone was enrolled with an EBAIS, everyone was contacted individually about a covid vaccination appointment—most at their neighborhood clinic and a few at home. One woman I met explained that she’d learned about her appointment by phone. I asked her what would happen if the EBAIS folks didn’t call. She looked at me puzzled. Maybe something was lost in translation. She repeated that she knew what week they would call, and they called. I persisted: What if they didn’t? She’d wait a couple of days and call herself, she said. It was no big deal. She asked me how things worked where I was from. I could only sigh.",
            "One of our visits that morning was to a brick house ringed by purple-flowered crape-myrtle trees. An eighty-year-old woman sat on the porch getting her hair dyed; during the pandemic, her hair stylist was also doing home visits. In a corner bedroom with lots of light, a small man with a regal profile and a shock of white hair was sitting up in a hospital bed, beneath a poster of Jesus. Tubing connected his nasal prongs to a large oxygen tank, its attached water-bubbler faintly audible. Salas recognized the man, who had been his father’s accountant. The man smiled brightly in greeting, but showed no sign of recognition. He had vascular dementia and chronic pulmonary disease.",
            "Up a winding mountain road, we reached a house with a huge mango tree standing sentinel, and dozens of ripe mangoes scattered beneath it. This time it was Salas who was recognized—his father had been the godfather of the seventy-eight-year-old man who lived there, with his wife. To Salas’s delight, the man pointed out a fading, sepia-toned picture of his godfather on the wall. The man, who had congestive heart failure and limited mobility, took the vaccine without complaint.",
            "For each of the households, Herrera keeps an electronic ficha familiar, a family file that provides the primary-care team with remarkably detailed information. This includes medical updates—what ailments have been assessed and what treatments have been administered on any given visit—but also notes on living conditions: whether the floors are dirt or finished, whether there is a refrigerator, a phone, or a computer, and even whether any animals are living “en condiciones insalubres.” According to the C.C.S.S., nearly sixty per cent of Costa Rica’s households have a current, geo-referenced file.",
            "There was nothing magical about the care I saw that day. Herrera wasn’t a saint. But he may have been something better than that: he was the point of contact between a national system and a great many individual lives, seeing to every small detail required for the broader demands of community health.",
            "Salas and I returned to the central clinic, where we met with the medical director of the Atenas Health Area, Carolina Amador. She is in her late forties, with long auburn hair and a quiet, observant air, and she oversees all seven EBAIS teams. Like Salas, she had wanted to be a doctor since she was in high school. And she, too, took the opportunity offered to Costa Rican medical graduates to spend a year working in an isolated community. It was around the time the EBAIS system was being launched, and she spent that year helping to provide primary care for an island fishing village, where basic supplies had to be delivered by boat. “I did Pap smears with a flashlight,” she recalled, sitting in her office behind a large wooden desk.",
            "Amador has overseen the Atenas Health Area for seventeen years. She says that the hardest part of her job involves human resources. “People want the director to be their parent, their adviser, their friend, and someone who can get them anything they want,” she said. “I am their psychologist, too. Everyone is motivated differently.”",
            "When Salas was growing up in Atenas, the nearest hospital was sixteen miles away, and understaffed. Now the area’s roughly thirty thousand residents are served by seven fully equipped EBAIS teams.",
            "She wants all the members of her teams to understand that their priority is “the relationship with the community, not just between the physician and patient.” This, she said, is the foundation of the EBAIS system. There are critical services that have to reach everyone in the community at every stage of life, she explained. Children have regular pediatric visits, starting from the first days of life. Pregnant women have their prenatal and postnatal checks. All adults have tests and follow-up visits to prevent and treat everything from iron deficiency to H.I.V. It’s all free. If people don’t show up for their appointments, she makes sure their team finds out why and figures out what can be done.",
            "Amador described a group program that her staff created for people who have poorly controlled diabetes. They meet on Mondays for two hours in a twelve-week course covering topics from cooking proper meals to administering their insulin. They learn far more than they would in sporadic office visits, and they become a group of peers who know and encourage one another. Amador and her colleagues have documented substantial reductions in blood-sugar levels. That led them to create other groups, including a Zoom forum that was begun as adolescent depression rose during the pandemic—the forum drew ninety teen-agers—and a nutrition program for bus drivers, who have been found to have a high rate of obesity.",
            "Salas was grinning. Everything he had created with his clinic in El Roble, everything he’d tried to build into the EBAIS system almost three decades ago, had come fully to life in his home town. A generation of professionals like Amador and Herrera had embraced his belief that individual health and public health are inseparable.",
            "Integrating the two has effects that aren’t so visible to patients. I spent the next morning with Mario Quesada, the primary-care physician for an EBAIS team serving the mountainside neighborhoods of Altos de Naranjo and San Isidro. Each week, he spends three days seeing patients at a clinic halfway up the mountain, and two days at a site on top of the mountain. I visited the one halfway up. It looked much like any other house on the street, which seemed to be the standard design for such clinics. Quesada, who is forty-one, wore a pin-striped, short-sleeved shirt and a microphone headset; during the pandemic, half his appointments have been virtual.",
            "By eight o’clock that morning, he’d already seen three patients—he’d diagnosed a benign rash, a goiter, and an ear infection. The first visit I observed was a telehealth appointment in which he advised a woman with migraines about a change in medication, typing up his notes as they spoke. These were routine visits, and would have been recognizable to primary-care doctors all over the world.",
            "Yet a couple of the visits I observed made apparent the subtle strengths of the EBAIS approach. One involved, as Quesada put it, “un caso difícil ”—an incontinent sixty-five-year-old woman with schizophrenia. The woman, who lives with her daughter, also has a psychiatrist and a social worker. That day, she needed her prescriptions refilled. But Quesada also saw a note in her ficha familiar about family circumstances which led him to ask her about her supply of diapers. The EBAIS provides up to forty a month, which was enough until her bowel troubles worsened recently. Quesada suspected that her daughter might not be able to afford more, and learned that the woman was indeed short. He did a quick check of the records and found that another family had returned a box of diapers after an elder died. She could have the box, he said. It was a small thing. But a lack of such basic supplies could mean the breakdown of skin from sitting too long in stool, and lead to infection and wound-care problems. Quesada’s simple reallocation of resources was possible only because he had a bigger picture of the community he serves.",
            "In another telehealth visit, a woman with diabetes and severe hypertension complained that she had been waiting more than a year to get follow-up blood tests. When Quesada consulted her records online, he saw that he had ordered the tests months earlier, but the woman hadn’t shown up for any of them. He told her where to go for her lab tests and filled out the lab orders that she’d need. He could have told her to pick up the order slips, but she’d failed to do that before, too. So Quesada looked through the upcoming appointment list and noticed that a neighbor of hers would be at the clinic soon. He told the woman he’d send her lab orders with the neighbor.",
            "That level of familiarity—the fact that he understood the community around his patient and how it could help—was astounding to me, even as the limitations seemed apparent.",
            "Herrera administered a flu vaccine at a resident’s home. Since the development of the EBAIS system, deaths from communicable diseases have fallen by ninety-four per cent.",
            "“She’s not going to get her tests done, is she?” I said.",
            "“It’s fifty-fifty,” he said. “One can only do so much. I do my work. They must do theirs.”",
            "In my discussions with clinicians and patients, the weaknesses in the system were not hard to find. With Costa Rica’s constrained resources, there was not enough staffing, especially for specialists. When it came to secondary care, months-long waits for advanced imaging and for procedures were common. People who could afford to do so carried additional insurance for private health care or paid cash to supplement the care that they received from the government. But the EBAIS system remains immensely popular, and politically untouchable. It has advantages that patients can feel, even if they don’t see all the inner workings.",
            "Near the end of my conversation with Carolina Amador, she explained her approach to the pandemic, and she called up a graph on her computer that showed up-to-the-moment rates of COVID cases and deaths by age, sex, and neighborhood. In Angeles, for instance, three per cent of the population had been infected; in Santa Eulalia, nine per cent had been. It was the kind of report I’d seen in the hands of local public-health officials in the United States. They generated these reports, but they hadn’t been given the tools or the authority to act on them directly. Because these officials remain outside the American health-care system, they had to beg providers to respond with adequate testing and vaccination. When that proved insufficient, they were forced to launch their own operations, such as drive-through testing sites and stadium vaccination clinics—and they had to do so from scratch, in a mad rush. The operations were all too delayed and temporary. Here, Amador could see the places with the greatest need and deploy doctors, nurses, and community-health workers to do testing and vaccination. Amid COVID, Costa Rica had demonstrated yet again how primary-care leaders could make health happen.",
            "The results are enviable. Since the development of the EBAIS system, deaths from communicable diseases have fallen by ninety-four per cent, and decisive progress has been made against non-communicable diseases as well. It’s not just that Costa Rica has surpassed America’s life expectancy while spending less on health care as a percentage of income; it actually spends less than the world average. The biggest gain these days is in the middle years of life. For people between fifteen and sixty years of age, the mortality rate in Costa Rica is 8.7 per cent, versus 11.2 per cent in the U.S.—a thirty-per-cent difference. But older people do better, too: in Costa Rica, the average sixty-year-old survives another 24.2 years, compared with 23.6 years in the U.S.",
            "The concern with the U.S. health system has never been about what it is capable of achieving at its best. It is about the large disparities we tolerate. Higher income, in particular, is associated with much longer life. In a 2016 study, the Harvard economist Raj Chetty and his research team found that the difference in life expectancy between forty-year-olds in the top one per cent of American income distribution and in the bottom one per cent is fifteen years for men and ten years for women.",
            "But the team also found that where people live in America can make a big difference in how their income affects their longevity. Forty-year-olds who are in the lowest quarter of income distribution—making up to about thirty-five thousand dollars a year—live four years longer in New York City than in Las Vegas, Indianapolis, or Oklahoma City. For the top one per cent, place matters far less.",
            "In a way, it’s a hopeful finding: if being working class shortens your life less in some places than in others, then evidently it’s possible to spread around some of the advantages that come with higher income. Chetty’s work didn’t say how, but it contained some clues. The geographic differences in mortality for people at lower socioeconomic levels were primarily due to increased disease rather than to increased injury. So healthier behaviors—reflected in local rates of obesity, smoking, and exercise—made a big difference for low earners, as did the quality of local hospital care. Chetty also found that low-income individuals tended to live longest, and have healthier behaviors, in cities with highly educated populations and high incomes. The local level of inequality, or the rates at which people were unemployed or uninsured, didn’t appear to matter much. What did seem to help was a higher level of local government expenditures.",
            "As an ATAP, Herrera brought COVID vaccines to certain patients who were unable to travel to their local clinics. Because every resident is enrolled with an EBAIS, everyone was contacted individually about a vaccination appointment.",
            "The Costa Rica model suggests that directing those expenditures wisely—in ways attentive to the greatest opportunities for impact—can be transformative when it comes to the less connected and the less advantaged. In an ingenious study, a group of Stanford economists compared families that include a doctor or a nurse with those that do not. The study focussed on Sweden, where, for many years, medical schools used a lottery to select among equally qualified applicants, providing the researchers with a set of otherwise matched families. The study found that people with a medically trained relative were ten per cent more likely to live beyond the age of eighty. Younger relatives were more likely to be vaccinated, were less likely to have drug or alcohol addiction, and had fewer hospital admissions. Older relatives had a lower rate of chronic illnesses such as heart disease. The study even found a “dose response” pattern: the closer that relatives lived to the family health professional, and the closer on the family tree, the larger the benefit. Relationships with people who can supply beneficial knowledge, authority, norms, and encouragement appear to make a major difference in mortality.",
            "There’s no public-health initiative that will add a doctor to your family, but Costa Rica shows that we can provide something close: a primary-care team whom individuals know personally and can call upon in the course of their lives. The country has reduced premature mortality at all income levels, but the largest declines have been at the lower end. In fact, by 2012 Costa Rica had largely eliminated disparities in infant mortality based on how much money families have or where they live. (In the U.S., babies born in high-poverty counties are almost twice as likely to die in their first year of life as those born in low-poverty counties—and it’s a similar story for those born in rural instead of suburban areas.)",
            "Other countries, including Sri Lanka and Colombia, have taken notice, and begun adopting key elements of the Costa Rica model. There’s no reason a U.S. city or state couldn’t do so, too. As the pandemic ebbs, countries will be assessing what went wrong with their public-health systems. A fundamental failure has been the separation of public health from health-care delivery. Getting that right, across the globe, could present our greatest opportunity to secure longer and better lives.",
            "What would this model look like in the United States? Consider the example of one common illness, viral hepatitis. Infection with either the hepatitis-B or the hepatitis-C virus can lead to severe liver damage and to chronic liver disease—a top-five cause of death for Americans between the ages of forty-five and sixty-four. It can also lead to liver cancer. More than four million people in the U.S. have a chronic hepatitis-B or hepatitis-C infection. Hepatitis C alone is the most common reason that American patients require liver transplants. We spend billions of dollars a year on treatment for these two viruses.",
            "I know the damage that viral hepatitis can do. My aunt, a former family physician in the Washington, D.C., area, slowly died from liver failure after contracting hepatitis B through an accidental needle stick in the nineteen-eighties. Today, we have an effective vaccine against hepatitis B, and hepatitis C has become curable with oral medications. If we had a system that let us expand screening, treatment, and vaccination, we could eliminate these diseases. Indeed, in 2017 the Department of Health and Human Services set that as a goal.",
            "But here again our system is designed for the great breakthrough, not the great follow-through. In Costa Rica, nearly ninety per cent of babies are vaccinated against hepatitis B at birth. (Mother-to-child transmission during childbirth is a significant pathway for infection.) In the U.S., only two-thirds are. Just twenty-five per cent of American adults are vaccinated against the virus. Our chronic-liver-disease rates have barely budged. In the meantime, new hepatitis-C infections have increased by almost thirty per cent since 2017. If every community had a primary-care team able to provide visits to all residents, we’d have a way to see that everyone had been offered vaccination and other preventive measures, screening for viral hepatitis, and prompt treatment for those found to have it. Viral hepatitis is markedly higher among immigrant Asian residents, African Americans, the poor, and intravenous drug users—precisely the people who have had the greatest difficulty in gaining access to medical care and advice.",
            "We know what needs to be done; we just don’t have the mechanisms to do it. Yet we’ve had glimpses of what we can accomplish with the right system in place. In the nineteen-nineties, the U.S. government launched a national effort to offer hepatitis-B vaccinations to all hospital workers, and, by the middle of the decade, two-thirds of them had got the jab; infections in this population were reduced by a remarkable ninety-eight per cent, from seventeen thousand cases in 1983 to just four hundred in 1995. How? Our hospital systems have dedicated personnel who get in touch with each of their employees at least once a year and offer them essential preventive care, including vaccinations, without charge. Yet those systems aren’t equipped to do the same for the people in the communities they serve. Costa Rica shows how they could be.",
            "“You have to come to this place with me,” Salas said on my last day in Costa Rica. I’d been hoping to spend more time in the clinic with the primary-care doctors, and wasn’t pleased that he’d decided on a visit to another coffee town—Palmares, a half hour’s drive from Atenas through the mountains.",
            "An elderly resident thanked Herrera after a visit. ATAPs are the point of contact between a national system and individual lives, seeing to the small details required for the broader demands of community health.",
            "“What’s there?” I asked.",
            "“A dental program,” he said. Responding to my skeptical look, he went on, “I’ve heard such good things about it. We will go.” He was still, decades on, a persuasive man.",
            "We arrived at the parking lot of a coffee-processing plant, and found a powder-blue bus with a big cartoon molar and a fat loop of cartoon floss on the door. On the side, in big block letters, it said, “¡Juntos construimos sonrisas!”—“Together we build smiles!” I was greeted by Alejandra Rodríguez, a white-coated dentist, who told me that the bus was donated by Chick-fil-A, which gets coffee beans from the Palmares plant. Inside, the bus was outfitted with three dental chairs, an X-ray machine, and enough supplies to provide dental cleanings and treatment for all the schoolchildren in the community.",
            "Dental care was not a significant part of the EBAIS structure that Salas helped design. But its systemic approach took root more widely. As Rodríguez explained to me, members of her profession helped lead an effort, starting in the nineteen-eighties, to institute after-lunch toothbrushing in elementary schools. Toothbrushes were provided for every student; rows of sinks were installed at schools, so that groups of children could brush at the same time. The program insured that all schoolchildren brushed their teeth at least once a day. The effort began in and around Palmares, and soon the idea was implemented across the country. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health required that table salt be fluoridated—an easier way to introduce fluoride on a national scale than fluoridating every town’s water supply.",
            "The results of such measures have been dramatic. In 1980, Costa Ricans averaged more than nine teeth decayed, missing, or filled by the age of twelve. By 2002, the number was below two. Today, it is below one—results as good as America’s or better, at a fraction of our costs.",
            "Rodríguez wanted to show us the new program she’s leading. Throughout the school year, the blue bus visits all nine elementary schools in Palmares, providing cleanings and treatment for every child whose parents permit it. On board, Salas and I saw a skinny sixth-grade boy have his teeth cleaned and get a sealant applied to his molars.",
            "Costa Ricans, it now struck me, had some of the best teeth I’d seen anywhere in my travels. Rodríguez and her partners were showing how dental care could be improved even further. They were integrating public health and individualized care—creating an actual health system—even in dentistry.",
            "“It is possible to change the picture,” Salas said to me afterward, reflecting on our visits inside the system he’d helped create so long ago. “It is possible to call upon a group of people, a group of Quixotes—do you know Quixote?—who think and can see twenty years, thirty years ahead. It is possible to raise an idea and see it supported by a younger generation to become real.”",
            "Public health can be a bulwark against the cynicism that public institutions sometimes inspire. Yet acceptance, Salas knew, always has to be earned. He recalled how anxious his grandmother was when the government first instituted a social-security contribution. “Because for the first time she had to pay something for the workers,” he said. “I remember she said to us, ‘The coffee harvest is good but not so good as to have money to pay workers now for social security.’ ” Every step is hard-fought.",
            "When Salas and I had walked through the cemetery, shortly after my arrival in Atenas, we’d stopped at his family plot, among the oldest there. His great-grandfather Guillermo, who died at forty-five, in 1894, and his great-grandmother Avelina, who died at sixty-five, in 1925, were buried there. In the next generation, his grandfather Emilio also died young, at forty-six, in 1931. Death seemed to take family members at random. His grandmother Guillerma lived to ninety-seven, but two of her children had died in infancy—one at sixteen months, from a respiratory illness that Salas suspected was whooping cough, and the other at twenty-four months, from diarrhea. In 1986, Salas buried his father, Emilio Salas Villalobos, in the plot, after his death, from colon cancer, at the age of seventy-four. In 2001, he buried his mother, Sara Chaves Villalobos, who also died at seventy-four, from a heart attack.",
            "I noticed that his mother’s name wasn’t on the family grave marker, and I asked him why.",
            "“I am responsible for not including my mother’s name and date,” he told me. “Possibly, I am waiting for the opportunity for writing our names and dates together, and forever.” Álvaro Salas Chaves is seventy years old now, and he imagines he might be joining her soon.",
            "But, owing to a health system he helped build, the average Costa Rican his age will live at least another sixteen years. Salas is sturdy, with no serious illnesses. Still, when the time comes, he intends to be buried in the same plot.",
            "“Because all of my family are here,” he explained. “They are all around. We will have a big meeting here.”"

        "paragraphs": [
            "On September 15th Costa Rica will be holding a special bicentennial celebration. Costa Rica gained independence on September 15, 1821, as a result of the Mexican War of Independence that lasted from 1810 until 1821. The country never had to fight for its independence, since Guatemala declared the independence of all countries in Central America on this historic date.",
            "Although Sept. 15th is the day when independence was declared in Central America, it took a month for the news to arrive in Costa Rica – on Oct. 13 – because a messenger had to travel by horseback from Guatemala with the official notice. Unlike other countries in the Americas, there was no war for independence in Central America.",

For example, this is what a good friend in California recently told me after selling his home for top dollar and a long bidding war between potential buyers, “I sold my house for silly money (big money) and was shocked what I received.” However, on the downside, everything is not so rosy since many potential home buyers now finding themselves priced out of the market.",
            "To make matters worse, ‘It’s highly unlikely that home prices will plummet,’ according to economists and real estate pros on what to expect home prices to do in 2022. Inventory shortages mean home prices may keep rising. High prices and demand for new housing in the U.S. has never been better but there is a lack of product. The supply of homes available for sale is so low that even a big dent in demand as a result of higher rates will not transform this into a buyer’s market, pros say. Home prices will keep going up because there aren’t enough houses available to meet demand, and the combination of rising home prices and elevated mortgage rates means fewer people will be able to afford to buy.”",
            "“Rapidly rising mortgage rates have had a negative impact on demand for mortgages since the start of the year, but there’s no indication that demand has plummeted. Barring some sort of large-scale mortgage defaulting that triggers massive home selloffs like what we saw prior to the 2008 financial collapse, or mortgage rates suddenly climbing to the double-digit levels they were at in the early 1980s, it seems like high home prices are here to stay.”",
            "So what does one do? Some are now looking to invest in more affordable foreign countries like Costa Rica. Those who live in countries plagued by major political uncertainty and potential social unrest are also turning their eyes toward Costa Rica because of the country’s enduring stability (Costa Rica is the longest-standing democracy in Latin America).",
            "The result: Costa Rica’s real estate market is flourishing and has become a viable investment option. As expected during the pandemic there was a lull in home sales here. But during the second half of 2021 and to date, there has been a real estate boom in the beach areas like Guanacaste, Jacó, and Dominical, in the Central Valley in outlying towns such as Atenas, Grecia, Puriscal, and San Ramón which are all experiencing a large influx of foreign investors including retirees. In southern Costa Rica, San Isidro de General has become an attractive option.",

            "It is said that “when the US sneezes Costa Rica catches a cold.” This demonstrates that what happens in a larger market can directly affect a smaller one which is happening here.",
